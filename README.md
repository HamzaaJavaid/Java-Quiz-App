**_‚óèTools Used:üéñüéñ_**    

1. Java: Programming language used for developing the Quiz

using Android Studio



**_‚óèTopics Covered:_**  

1. Client-Server Architecture: The Quiz Application follows a client-server model where the server sends quiz questions to
the connected clients.
2. Socket Programming: Java Sockets are used to establish communication between the server and clients over a
network.
3. User Authentication: Users are required to provide a one-time username and password for logging into the quiz
server.
4. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs): The quiz questions are presented as MCQs with four options.
5. Timer: Each question has a time limit of 15 seconds for the
user to answer.
6. File Handling: The application utilizes file handling to store quiz questions, user credentials, and quiz answers in separate
files.
